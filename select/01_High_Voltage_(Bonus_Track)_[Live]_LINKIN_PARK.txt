Sometimes, sometimes, sometimes
Sometimes, sometimes, hybrid

I've been diggin' in the crates ever since I was livin' in space
Before the rat race, before monkeys had human traits
I mastered numerology, big band theology
Performed lobotomies with telekinetic psychology

Invented the mic so I can start blessin' it
Chin-checkin' kids to make my point like an impressionist
Many men have tried to shake us
But I twist mic chords like double helixes
To show them what I'm made of

I buckle knees like leg braces
Cast a spell of instrumentalist on all of you MC's who hate us
So, you can try on, leave you without a shoulder to cry on
From now to infinity, let icon be bygones

I fire bombs, ghostly notes haunt this
I tried threats but moved on to a promise
I stomp shit with or without an accomplice
And run the guantlett with whoever that wants this

High voltage
(This is the unforgettable sound)
High voltage
(Bringin' you up and takin' you down)
High voltage
(Comin' at you from every side)
High voltage
(Making the rythm and rhyme collide)

Akira, I've put a kink in the backbones of clones with microphones
Never satisfied my rhymes Jones
Spraying bright day over what you might say
My blood types krylon, Technicolor type A

On highways write with road rage
Cages a winning, cages a tin that bounce all around
Surround sound, devouring the scenes
Subliminal gangrene paintings, over all the same things

Sing song karaoke copy bullshit
Break bones verbally with sticks and stone tactics
Forth dimension, compact convention
Write rhymes with ease while the track stands in attention

Meant to put you away, with the pencil
Pistol, official, sixteen line, a rhyme missile
While you risk your all, I pick out at your flaws
Spin, rah, blah, blah, blah, you can say you saw

High voltage
(This is the unforgettable sound)
High voltage
(Bringin' you up and takin' you down)
High voltage
(Comin' at you from every side)

Who's the man, the man in your hand over your land
Roving over man's bolding, fellow when he's jammin' your plans ova?
I am Vics Clorousos, the most ferocious
When I spy my third eye, it's extremely high voltage

That's why I need ruby corks glasses
'Cause when I glance at the chest that I might blast the masses
Subliminals transmitted through piano
Integrated in flow, calculated to nano

My I U skills when I mean plea sees the rhyme
I hear when I bleed when I proceed through time
I walk through walls and inanimate obstacles
While inducing a reduction of cells and molecules

I bring the knowledge, you swallow a state, that's the Hologram
I bot your head, fat and your lip like collagen
A telepath of anothers with no postage
Fellow march, Mike Shinoda, we high voltage

High voltage
(This is the unforgettable sound)

(Bringin' you up and takin' you down)
High voltage
